      <div className="description">
        I’ve started coding around 2018, most of my education comes from paid
        courses from experienced developers. Three months after i’ve started
        studying i landed my first freelance job and i faced it from all the
        aspects while i was progressing through my studies.
        <br />
        <br /> I have a curious profile and i enjoy learning and challenges,
        always looking for new technologies to learn and improve my daily tasks.
        I’m also very given with the client, this comes from my job experience
        prior to becoming a developer where i used to provide Customer Service.
